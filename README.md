# MemOnPology : A Perspective Analysis of SocialPolitical Memes

## Overview

Internet memes are a fundamental aspect of communication in the social media sphere. One of their core mechanisms is recontextualization, which involves transferring and transforming information from one context to another. This process leverages multimodal signs such as language and images to create meaning through shared cultural characteristics.

Our project investigates sociopolitical memes, aiming to demonstrate how their recontextualization dynamics shape public perception and interpretation of specific social and political issues. By analyzing their mediatic components, we explore how different perspectives emerge within political discourse.
